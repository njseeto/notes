### notes

#### To create a new post:
- Create a new file in `posts`
- Have the relevant metdata (title, date, description, tags)
- Run `hugo server`
- View the post on `localhost:1313`
- If done run the deploy script `./deploy.sh`
- This will deploy the changes to the live site and builds the project from the public folder.
- Don't forget to commit changs to ensure the project is up to date.

<br>

*No need to make any direct changes to the `public` folder.*

These files will change when the deploy script is run.
