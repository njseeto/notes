### Message of the ~~week~~ fortnight
"We are all visitors to this time, this place. We are just passing through. Our purpose here is to observe, to learn, to grow, to love... and then we return home."

-Australian Aboriginal Proverb


### Who taught me something or really made me think this ~~week~~ fortnight?
I want to preface this by saying that I know connection to country is of great significance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but my understanding of that is limited. To be honest since living in another country I had forgotten this significance. During my time back home I have been reminded of the importance of the land to the indigenous people and have tried to be more aware of this during my time back home.

I had a discussion with a friend and she really made me think about our connection with the land. She spoke about how we as Australians need to start taking responsibility for learning and educating ourselves about indigenous culture and our relationship with the land. Our ignorance is not something that we should burden onto the indigenous population. It is not their responsibility to drag us out of our ignorance. This can be said for so many other aspects of society; those who identify as cis gendered should take it upon themselves to learn about our non-binary pals, those who are neurologically alike should learn about those who are neurologically diverse - the list goes on.

In the same breath, we shouldn't wallow in our guilt. Internalised guilt can be complacent and a passive way to deal with the issues at hand. The only positivity that can be drawn from our guilt is for it to act as a catalyst for change.

She continued by talking about her efforts to understand her connection and her existence in relation to the land and its history. An example she gave was the creek that she runs along every day. This creek is culturally significant for the indigenous people of that area - the Wurrundjeri-willam people. The creek supplied the Wurrundjeri-willam people with eel, shellfish and duck for 40,000 years. Important ceremonies such as marriages and burials for clan heads and fallen warriors were also held along the creek. Now when she runs along the river she thinks about her connection to the land; past, present and future.

Also on this, it was super heart warming to hear the MC at my friend's wedding state that the ceremony was not the first of its kind on the land. The world's oldest civilisation (the Aborginal people) would've had similar ceremonies on these lands. He then went on to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land they were on - the Wiradjuri people. Sadly, this acknowledgement to country was so touching because it is something I rarely hear at events in Australia.


### What am I trying to work out?
This trip has made me realise how I love being in Australia. So these past couple of weeks have left me thinking about when I'd like to move back to this fine country.
It's a balance between getting enough experience in a city that is truly a world city, bustling with tech start ups and a very active tech scene, with my desire to come home and be around family and close friends.


### How can I be better next week?
I was gifted a keep cup during this trip. This has compelled me to be more waste conscious and reduce single use plastics.


### What am I looking forward to next week?
Getting back to work! Having a routine again.
