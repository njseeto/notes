#### What is this?
A blog. Yes another blog.

It's a place that I do not expect many people to deliberately seek out, stumble upon sure but not stay for long. The reason for this blog is a purely selfish one. This is a place to keep my musings and an easy way to direct people (mainly myself) to information.

#### What can you expect?
To be perfectly honest - fairly irregular blog posts.

In terms of content, articles about technology and software development practices, musings about the differences between the public health and technology sectors, my experience with the Tier 1 Visa for Digital Technology and tips on getting one, the boot camp experience and (if you're lucky) what it's like to make a guerilla documentary with absolutely no experience.

I currently keep weekly notes. I find this is a great way to reflect and learn from the week. If I'm feeling truly inspired I may start posting these regularly.
