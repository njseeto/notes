**UPDATE**

**Criteria for this visa has recently changed.** Therefore, not everything in this post may be applicable to your case. Please refer to the [GovUK Tier 1 Overview](https://www.gov.uk/tier-1-exceptional-talent) page for the most up to date information.

**Please refrain from asking me about your application.** I am not an immigration lawyer and cannot legally advise anyone. This is not legal advice. This article comprises of general information and my personal experience with the visa.

___________________________

A little background, I have been living in London since May 2016. I came in on the Youth Mobility visa, which gave me 2 years. I knew I wanted to stay in the UK but having just switched careers the likelihood of getting sponsored in my new career was slim. Alternatively, I was offered a sponsored role through my previous profession (paediatric occupational therapist) but I was determined to make my new career as a developer work. I had no idea how I could do this with limited experience in my new career.

**Enter the [Tier 1](https://www.gov.uk/tier-1-exceptional-talent) visa.**

Getting this visa took about 4 months of work and not many people know about this option. I wanted to write this up to help those who are thinking about applying.


<h2>What is the Tier 1 visa?</h2>
The visa is for those who currently show talent or promise in a specific field. There are a number of different fields you can apply under, eg: Digital Technology, Arts and Culture, Humanities. Each field has its own criteria and governing body who assess the applications.

There are **200** of these visas issued annually for digital technology.

Note: Since I only have experience for the for Digital Technology route, the remainder of this article will outline the process I went through under that category.

<h2>Who judges the application?</h2>
For the Digital Technology field, you will need to submit your evidence to [Tech Nation UK](https://technation.io/visa/) who will then assess whether your application meets the criteria.

<h2>What are the conditions of the visa?</h2>
You can apply under the Exceptional Talent or the Exceptional Promise route. Itâ€™s best to read up on the latest conditions which is usually available at [TechNation](https://technation.io/visa/). 
The conditions are:

- Visas can be granted for up to 5 years if applying from within the UK and 5 years and 4 months if applying from outside the UK.
- You can apply for settlement under this visa.
- The visa allows you to work and change employers or be self-employed without having the need for further sponsorship.
- Dependents are allowed subject to requirements.

The major wins here are the length of time you are granted and the flexibility with working.


<h2>How much did this whole thing cost you?</h2>
The most up to date fees will be found on the [UK Gov website](https://www.gov.uk/tier-1-exceptional-talent). There are 2 stages to this visa (more info below) and you will need to pay for both stages of the visa. 

For me, Stage 1 cost Â£456 and Stage 2 cost Â£152. I also paid for the NHS surcharge, which is Â£200/year. You can choose to get the visa for 3 years or 5 years, I opted for 5 years so paid Â£1000 for the NHS surcharge.

So in total, I paid **Â£1,608** for 5 years and 4 months.

Note: You will only pay for Stage 2 if you get the letter of endorsement and choose to go ahead.


<h2>What is the process?</h2>
Before we even look at the process, I would recommend setting a hard deadline for the stages. I had the threat of deportation so my deadline was evident.

There are 2 stages to the visa application

__Stage 1: Apply to be endorsed__

This is where you submit your evidence covering specific criteria. If Stage 1 is successful, you will receive a letter of endorsement (via email) allowing you to move onto Stage 2.

__Stage 2: Visa application to the Home Office__

This is the usual visa application, ie. fill in forms about your criminal history, medical history etc.

<h2>Stage 1</h2>
There are 2 main steps in Stage 1.


__1. Apply to the Home Office for the endorsement stage__

This needs to be done before TechNation will assess your application.
[Apply here](https://visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/tier-1-exceptional-talent-endorsement)

__2. Apply to TechNation__
<br>

This is done via the TechNation application portal, which can be found [here](https://tech-nation-visa.smapply.io/prog/tech_nation_visa_application/). Through this portal you will need to include the following:

- A visa application form
- Personal statement (up to 1000 words)
- Two letters of recommendation
- Your evidence in response to criteria
- A current CV
- Job offer (if you have one)


**Note: Once you submit this, you cannot make any further changes or additions.**


<h2>What is the criteria?</h2>
You have 2 different criteria depending on if you choose to go down the Exceptional Talent or Exceptional Promise route. You canâ€™t mix the two criteria.

Up to date criteria can be found at [TechNation](https://technation.io/visa/). But it all boils down to whether you already have a **proven track record** of success (TALENT) or you have **potential** to be a leader (PROMISE).

<h2>How do I set out my application?</h2>
Your application should have the following pieces:

- CV (no more than x2 A4 sides)
- Personal Statement (up to 1000 words)
- 2x Letters of Recommendation
- Your evidence for the set criteria

How you set out your CV and personal statement is a personal preference, so I will not comment on these.


__Letters of Recommendation__

Letters should have the following information:

- From a UK or internationally based recognised expert in the digital technology sector
- Letters must be written on letter headed paper wherever possible and include details of the authorâ€™s credentials (CV/resume/linkedIn profile) as well as full contact details
- Letters must be signed and dated (electronic signatures will be accepted in certain circumstances)
- Include details of any further professional engagements you have in the UK
- Full contact details of author including personal email address and direct telephone number so that personal contact can be made.


**Tips:** The more senior the reference the better, the more well-known the company the better. Try to get refereees who do not work with you. If you have more than two great letters, have a think about whether you can slot them into your pack of evidence. A reference letter from a well respected referee can be worth much more than a certificate for completing an online course.


__Evidence__

Note there are many ways to set out this section of our application, *as long as it is clear which criteria corresponds to which piece of evidence*. The panel judging the visa will have a number of applications to get through so *make it easy* for them.

I set my evidence out by putting the criteria I am fulfilling at the top of the page and a list outlining the evidence. I then added screenshots (which included emails and Twitter), links to github repos/websites/projects and letters. I added a small blurb describing the evidence where I thought it was needed. 

*PRIMARY* criteria example:
![primary_criteria_example](/images/primary_example.png)

<br>


*QUALIFYING* criteria example:
![qualifying_criteria_example](/images/qualifying_example.png)


**Tips:** Get involved in the community, volunteer, mentor, go to hackathons. Make sure to also document these through photos, correspondence emails, Twitter posts. Everything you do over the months of application is potential evidence for this visa.

The main piece of advice I give to people is to __tell a story__. Find criteria and evidence that sells you as a whole.


<h3>Ok so after reading over my application a thousand times, I have *finally* submitted my application, what do I do now?</h3>

Firstly, HUGE CONGRATS! This is super tough work and super super super stressful. So high fives and back pats for you!

But now comes (in my opinion) the hardest part - the waiting game... ðŸ˜¬

I waited 6 weeks before I got a response from the Home Office, but expect to wait up to 8 weeks.


<h3>How do I know when the waiting game is over?</h3>

You will get an ominous email in your inbox that looks something like this...
![inbox](/images/inbox.png)

It's ok, you can open it because either way it will look like this...

![email](/images/email.png)


Don't panic! You've done all you can and if it's not the response you wanted you can lodge an [endorsement review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-for-endorsement-for-tier-1-exceptional-talent-visa).

Ok, now is the scariest bit of the whole process. It took me a good 20 minutes of heavy encouragement from a close friend before I worked up the courage to read the PDF attached to the email.

<h2>Stage 2</h2>
This is the sweet sweet point where all of your hard work has paid off and you have that golden letter of recommendation in your hand. 

Things to keep in mind:

- You have 3 months to cash in your letter for the visa
- This is the application to the Home Office, so you still need to fill out the usual forms for the immigration visa application process.
- You can apply within the UK or outside of the UK.
- Expect to wait for the visa to be processed (I applied for fast track and still ended up waiting **4 weeks**)
- Make sure you have enough cash in your accounts to pay for this stage!
- Print out all of your documentation, visa application, letter of recommendation (check this multiple times)


<h2>Ending Thoughts</h2>
Applying for this visa is quite stressful. I am forever grateful to my friends and family for their patience and support. Part of the reason why I am writing this is to give others an insight into what to expect.
Please surround yourself with supportive people during this process, you may find yourself needing some words of encouragement and possibly a shoulder to cry on.
