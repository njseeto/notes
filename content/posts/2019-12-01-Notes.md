### TL, DR;

#### Work things:
- [The Future of CyberSecurity](https://cybereurope.events/programme) conference â†’ I'll write up a quick overview of the conference when I get time.
- Watched [Mastering Chaos - A Netflix Guide to Microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ3wIuvmHeM)
- Played around with [Cloudcraft](https://cloudcraft.co/)
- Held an event at work involving high school students and the [Mayor's Fund for London](https://www.mayorsfundforlondon.org.uk/)
- Decommissioned an application that is no longer used. It's super satisfying deleting code.
- Discussed the best practice for acccessing data from a database. Should we always put an API over a database?


#### General life things:
- Friendsgiving meal.
- Remembered how much I love cycling around London. (Sunshine, please stay longer!).
- Black Friday sales (I bought a slow cooker... amongst other things).
- Thought about the possibility of attending [Eurovision 2020](https://eurovision.tv/event/rotterdam-2020). #rotterdam2020

### Message of the week
You can do things!


I put into practice what I wanted to achieve from last week, which was to trust in my judgement and knowledge. This resulted in not second guessing my skills, completing a ticket to decomission an application (this meant extracting it from a monolithic application, taking out code related to infrastructure in another project and looking into whether particular S3 buckets could be deleted). Plus I began work on a new feature.


### Who taught me something or really made me think this week?
Most recent conversations about the future focus on the point where technology surpasses human **capability**. But they overlook a much earlier point where technology exceeds human **vulnerabilities**.

-[The Centre for Humane Technology](https://humanetech.com/problem/)


This was quoted at the cybersecurity conference I attended this week and boy did it stick.


### What am I trying to work out?
We had a panel at work this week. I enjoy being on a panel but everytime I am asked to speak on a panel I have an internal diaglogue which goes something like this...

"This is great! They want different perspectives, but am I on here because I am the most diverse person?"


Also
"If I say yes then I will be spending less time on things that I really should/want to be focussing on ie. being a developer."


This is a constant internal struggle for me and I am super conscious about when I agree to panels / diversity work. I am still trying to strike a balance.


### How can I be better next week?
Get more done with my Python side project - I feel like I have been neglecting it a little...


### What am I looking forward to next week?
A week that is quiet, hello Netflix and book reading time!
